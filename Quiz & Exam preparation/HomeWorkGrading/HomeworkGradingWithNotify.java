/**
 * This class represents two assistants who grade homeworks.
 * Grading one homework takes around one second. But since the
 * two assistants split their work, they can grade twice as fast.
 * That means grading six homeworks should take around 3 seconds.
 * You should implement the assistants as two separate threads.
 *
 * You MUST use the basic Thread class.
 * DO NOT use futures and thread pools.
 *
 * Avoid race conditions.
 * Catch exceptions (and ignore them).
